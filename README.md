This is a simple Rails 7.1 application built based on Rails "blog app" guide.
We will be using this app to learn how to deploy a Rails app to VPS with Kamal.

- [Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-the-blog-application)
- [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/)

Pre-requisites:
- Ruby 3.3.3

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
